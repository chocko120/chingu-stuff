    <span>Write a function to locate a substring within another string.

        Your function must be named searchForSubstring and it should accept two parameters
        - a string to be searched and substring to be located within it.

        This function should return an integer reprsenting the zero-based starting position of the substring,
        or -1 if it was not found. For example,

        let foundAtPosition = searchForSubstring(stringToSearch, stringToLookFor)

        Both the string to be searched and the substring to be searching for may be of any length.
        These strings may contain any combination of letters, numbers, and punctuation.

        Edge cases to test for include a substring to be searched for that is empty or
        longer than the string to be searched and a string to be searched that is of zero length.
